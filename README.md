*HOW IT IS DONE*: THIS TASK WAS DONE BY UTILIZING THE GPT-2 (GENERATIVE PRE-TRAINED TRANSFORMER 2) MODEL FROM THE TRANSFORMERS LIBRARY, WHICH IS WELL-KNOWN FOR ITS ABILITY TO GENERATE HUMAN-LIKE TEXT. UPON RECEIVING A PROMPT, THE MODEL TOKENIZED THE INPUT AND GENERATED EXTENDED, CONTEXTUALLY RELEVANT TEXT USING ITS MASSIVE DATASET OF PRE-LEARNED LANGUAGE PATTERNS. THE USER NEEDS TO TYPE THE PROMPT AND THE MODEL WILL GENERATE A TEXT FOR IT.
